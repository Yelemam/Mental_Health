# Project Overview

The Mental Health Data Engineering project focuses on analyzing mental health data to uncover trends, correlations, and insights. The objective of this 
project is to understand mental health patterns and provide a data-driven platform to visualize these findings using interactive web applications.

# Folder Structure Explanation

    •    data/: Contains raw and cleaned datasets used for analysis and visualization.
    •    database/: Includes the SQL schema and scripts for database creation and management.
    •    notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis.
    •    webapp/: Contains the Flask web application files, including app.py, HTML templates, and static files (CSS, images).
    •    static/: Sub-directory within webapp that holds static resources like stylesheets and images.
    •    templates/: Sub-directory within webapp that contains HTML templates for the Flask app.
    •    README.md: This document provides an overview of the project and its components.

# Data Sources

    •    Kaggle Dataset: Used for obtaining a variety of mental health data, including surveys and statistical reports.
    •    CDC Dataset: Provides data on mental health trends and conditions, supporting the analysis of public health statistics.
    •    Data was pre-processed to ensure consistency and relevance for the analysis.

# Database Creation Process

    •    The database was initially created using direct imports from Jupyter Notebook 3. The transformed data was loaded directly into the database.
    •    Following the data import, the database tables were altered to include primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) to establish relationships and enhance data integrity.
    •    The database design adheres to standard normalization principles, ensuring optimized storage and efficient querying.

# ETL Workflow

    •    Extraction: Data was extracted from various sources, including CSV files from Kaggle and CDC.
    •    Transformation: Data cleaning and transformation processes were conducted to handle missing values, normalize formats, and prepare the data for analysis.
    •    Load: The processed data was loaded into a PostgreSQL database, with tables linked by PKs and FKs to support robust data analysis.
    •    Visualization: An ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) was created to visually represent the database schema and table relationships.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    •    Detailed analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data and identify key trends.
    •    Visualizations were created to highlight correlations between different variables, such as gender, treatment, and self-employment status.
    •    The EDA provided insights into the factors influencing mental health, guiding the development of targeted visualizations in the web app.

# Flask Web Application

    •    The Flask web application serves as an interactive interface for users to engage with the data.
    •    Features:
    •    Data Table: Allows users to filter and explore data dynamically.
    •    Interactive Charts: Displays visualizations of mental health trends, with filtering options for deeper insights.
    •    Responsive Design: Ensures that the app is accessible across different devices.
    •    Integration: The web app integrates seamlessly with the database, enabling real-time data interaction and visualization.

# Tools and Technologies

    •    Python & Jupyter Notebooks: Used for data analysis, ETL, and exploratory data analysis.
    •    PostgreSQL: The database platform used to store and manage the data.
    •    Flask: Web framework used to create the interactive web application.
    •    Plotly: Library used for creating dynamic charts and visualizations.
    •    SQLAlchemy: For database operations and handling queries in the web app.

# Challenges and Solutions

    •    Static File Serving: Encountered issues with serving static files in Flask, which were resolved by explicitly setting the static file path.
    •    Data Cleaning: Addressed challenges related to inconsistent data formats and missing values during the transformation phase.
    •    Database Optimization: Implemented table normalization and indexing to improve query performance and data retrieval speed.

# Future Enhancements

    •    Machine Learning Integration: Plan to include predictive models to identify trends in mental health conditions.
    •    Extended Data Sources: Explore additional datasets to enrich the analysis and provide more comprehensive insights.
    •    Enhanced Visualizations: Add more interactive charts and filters to enable deeper exploration of the data.

# Ethical Considerations

    •    Data Privacy: Care was taken to ensure that any sensitive information was anonymized to protect individual privacy.
    •    Transparency: All data sources and analysis methods are documented to maintain transparency and reproducibility.
    •    Ethical guidelines were followed to ensure that data is used responsibly and respectfully in understanding mental health.
